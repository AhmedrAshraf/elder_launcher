## Most important rule: All commits must be made in **dev** branch.
Other than that, the guidelines stated below are very lax and you can start contributing in no time

## Features and UI/UX Changes
Elder Launcher focuses on **Legibility** and **Simplicity**. All new features and visual changes must adhere to this.

Before working on any new major features or changing the appearance of the app, please post about in the relevant section of the project's Github Discussions [page](https://github.com/itsarjunsinh/elder_launcher/discussions). This is to ensure your work aligns with the vision of the project.

## Translations
Adding new translations or improving existing translations is hugely beneficial. However, please send separate PRs for translation changes.
ie. Do not include them with PRs bugfix/feature/UI changes.
